# Getting Started with Apache Pinotâ„¢: Visualization with SuperSet

## Introduction

Apache Superset is an open-source data visualization and data exploration platform designed to be highly intuitive and visually appealing. It allows users to create and share interactive dashboards and visualizations, supporting a wide array of data sources. Superset's strength lies in its ability to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring and visualizing large datasets, making data analysis accessible to non-technical users.

Apache Pinot is a real-time distributed OLAP datastore, optimized for low-latency, high-throughput analytical queries. It is designed to provide instant insights on data at scale, making it a popular choice for applications in time-sensitive data analysis scenarios.

Pairing Apache Superset with Apache Pinot makes sense due to the complementary strengths of the two systems. While Pinot provides the backend infrastructure capable of querying massive datasets at high speed, Superset offers the front-end interface that allows users to explore, visualize, and share those insights easily. Together, they form a powerful stack for real-time analytics, enabling users to derive actionable insights from their data rapidly.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this workshop, you will learn:

1. The basic concepts and features of Apache Superset and Apache Pinot.
2. How to integrate Apache Superset with Apache Pinot to leverage real-time data analytics.
3. The steps to configure a data source in Superset connected to a Pinot cluster.
4. How to use Apache Superset's UI to create dynamic and interactive dashboards based on data from Apache Pinot.

## Prerequisite

Before diving into the process, you should have the following:

* A basic understanding of data visualization concepts.
* Docker installed and running in your environment.

## Step By Step instructions

### Deploying Superset and Pinot

In order to support SuperSet with Pinot, I am using docker compose.  Run the following command to run Superset and Pinot instaces.

```sh
docker-compose up -d 
```

You can verify deployment - which takes a few minutes to start by launching the following URLs:

* <http://localhost:9000> <- Pinot deployment
* <https://localhost:8088> <- Superset deployment>

### Setup Admin account

This step sets up Superset Admin account.  It needs to be run once per container.

```sh
docker ps # to get the container id
docker exec -it <containerid> superset fab create-admin --username admin --firstname Superset --lastname Admin --email admin@superset.com --password admin
docker exec -it <containerid> superset db upgrade
docker exec -it <containerid> superset init
```

### Import Pre-Built Pinot Datasource and Dashboard

Superset supports import/export for Dashboards, charts, datasets and database connections.  In this excercise, we will import a dashboard with four charts.  The charts display data from the AirlineStats table in the PInot Quickstart.

* To import, navigate to the dashboard, and select the import icon as shown below:
![SuperSet Import](/images/superset-import.png "SuperSet Import")
* Click on Import File.
* Import the file "dashboar_export_airlinestat.zip"
![SuperSet Import](/images/superset-import-2.png "SuperSet Import: Select File")
* This should import the data connection, datasets, charts and dashboard.

Feel free to explore the interface, charts etc.

### Teardown

To stop the running containers, use the following command:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

### Conclusion

There you have it!  We have successfully deployed Superset and Pinot, working together, and run some dashboards on Superset.
